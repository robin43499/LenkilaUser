*Note: The sample code design was inspired by [Tryolabs Mobile Showcase](http://blog.tryolabs.com/2015/05/12/tryolabs-mobile-showcase-going-full-mobile/)*

## Usage

First, import ```MCMHeaderAnimated```:

```swift
import MCMHeaderAnimated
```

Create a new instance of ```MCMHeaderAnimated``` in the list controller, like this:

```swift
private let transitionManager = MCMHeaderAnimated()
```

then, assign that to the transitioningDelegate property of the destination controller:

```swift
destination.transitioningDelegate = self.transitionManager
```

and finally extend MCMHeaderAnimatedDelegate and implement __headerView__ and __headerCopy__ functions in both controllers.

If you want to add user interaction to dismiss detail view, like the example, you can add the following line:

```swift
self.transitionManager.destinationViewController = destination
```

## Requirements

iOS 8.0+
